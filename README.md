# 6511---Shortest-Path
Finding the Shortest Path with Dijkstras and A*

Project 1: Shortest Path (Uninformed + Informed Search)

For my project I chose to run it in jupyter notebooks with Python. I will attach the notebook along
with a .py file. I chose to use Dijsktras algorithm to find the shortest path in the uninformed search
and then I used the Manhattan distance from the squares as a heuristic in my A* informed search. I
created dictionaries with the necessary values in order to plug them in to functions that I created for
each of the two algorithms. If you are to run it in a notebook. All you need to do is click run and
each cell will run perfectly.

I found that the A* algorithm found the shortest path in less steps than when using dijsktras
algorithm
